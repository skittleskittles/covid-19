# COVID-19 Visualization

## Introduction
This project is a COVID-19 visual analytics system, which includes three modules: spatiotemporal situation, transmission patterns, and public opinion analysis.

The project is built with Django and Echarts.

## Content
- **Spatiotemporal Situation of the Pandemic**: Analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, examines the trends in newly confirmed cases, total confirmed cases, recovery rates, and mortality rates, and monitors the development of the pandemic.

- **Pandemic Transmission Patterns**: Links population mobility, population density, and pandemic development trends to analyze transmission patterns and compare the differences in transmission across regions.

- **Public Opinion Analysis**: Analyzes the most frequently mentioned COVID-19-related keywords on Sina Weibo, tracks changes in keyword frequency, and studies the dynamic evolution of users' sentiments about the pandemic to perform situational awareness of public opinion.
